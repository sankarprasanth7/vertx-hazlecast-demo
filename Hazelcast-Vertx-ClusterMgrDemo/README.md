# Hazelcast-Vertx-ClusterMgrDemo
A demo for Hazelcast Cluster Management on Vertx
## Description
Hi there, welcome to my Hazelcast-Vertx-Cluster Management Demo. Well, just a small project to kill time in weekends.

Its main verticle is a Http server whose a GET request handler sending a message to a Worker every time it receive new request.

The worker has some calculations which take times to response back to main verticle.

The aim is to let main verticle reaches a state which it's unable to handle anymore request because all of workers in pool are used up.

Then, Cluster design jumps in and demonstrate how it will solve the problem.
